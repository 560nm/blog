## Random Power Hour

I recently just wrapped up a small one day project. Building a random power hour creator in Meteor. It pulls YouTube videos from a selected playlist, mixes them up, and plays random clips from them, creating the perfect drinking game! You can visit the site below:

## The Code

The entire website is open source and available on my github [here](https://github.com/quackware/meteor-randomhour). Make sure to leave any comments or suggestions you have.
