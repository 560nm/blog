## Introduction

I usually always have to google the steps to create a Meteor package, so I figured I would do a write up for myself that I can reference. I hope this helps anyone else that has trouble creating a meteor package

## The Steps

### 1. Create the package


Open a terminal and navigate to the directory you want to store the package in. Type

    meteor --create package atmosphereusername:packagename

### 2. Create the test application

Enter the following commands. This will create a test app you can use to test your package.

    cd packagename
    meteor create test-app
    cd test-app

### 3. Create a packages folder for test-app

We need a place to store our new package in our test app

    mkdir packages

### 4. Symlink your package to the test-app

Now we can link our new package into our test-app, so that any modifications we make to the package will show up in our app.

    cd packages
    ln -s ../../../packagename ./packagename

### 5. Add the package

All that's left is to add the package to our test-app

    meteor add atmosphereusername:packagename


## Conclusion

That's it. Now when you run `meteor list` in your test-app you should see the packagename show up. Now go write the next awesome meteor package!
